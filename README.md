## Need help on your javascript/react app?

I am sort of like a ghost writer, but for apps. I build it, you get to watch how I do it, it launches on time, with few bugs, and you get to take the credit!

We can work in hourly session blocks, and you can have a recording of our work to review at your own pace!

## Happy hacking!
