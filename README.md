## Hello world! My name is [Mark Tellez] ðŸ‘‹

I am a Sr. Software developer who loves JavaScript, React, Next, and Mongo! I spend about half of my time mentoring new, jr, and mid level developers and making Youtube videos, tutorials, and even small films!

I am available for hire to supercharge your development team with all my years of experience in web devleopment.

# Been writing code for over 25 years, learned from it

- :tada: I focus mainly on web 2 & 3 apps built using NextJS React, Ethers, Polygon, and of course, Solidity
- :computer: I teach JavaScript, React, Blockchain, and HTML/CSS via live mentorship @ [DevmentorLive]
- :tv: I release screencasts weekly on JavaScript and React @ [Youtube]
- :fist: According to [16Personalities], I am a Mediator Personality, along with JRR Tolkien, William Shakespeare and Thomas Jefferson!

## Need help on your javascript/react app?

I am sort of like a ghost writer, but for apps. I build it, you get to watch how I do it, it launches on time, with few bugs, and you get to take the credit!

We can work in hourly session blocks, and you can have a recording of our work to review at your own pace!


## Happy hacking!
